### The Quest

Our mission (and we choose to accept it) is to create the ultimate platform for board game browsing, reviewing, discussing, favoriting, and cataloguing (?), optimizing the user experience for all who enter here, from the squire to the Queen's Hand.

### The Experience

Main functionalities, or *epics* if you will, include:
* A user arrives to the home page and sees a view of most popular (most favorited) and best-selling (most owned) games in our catalogue.
* A user can search by title in the search bar, or click "Advanced Search" to view games of certain categories, mechanisms, players, etc.
* A user can view a game page with all details and reviews of that game.
* A user can visit the forums to see other users' opinions, announcements, and conversations.
* A user can register/log in for additional features...
  * a profile page (library), which includes lists of owned and favorited games
  * access to write reviews of games and post in the forums
