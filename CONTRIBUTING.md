## Pull Request Workflow

1. Create a branch named for the feature you are working on.
2. Write code.
3. Commit your code and write a good commit message.
4. Push your branch and changes to your Github repository.
5. Create a pull request to your cohort organization.

## Code Review Workflow

1. Another teammate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github.
  * Check out the branch and test for functionality.
  * Check for code styling so things are tidy.
2. You make the desired changes (using the Pull Request Workflow).
3. Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made.
4. The code reviewer merges the pull request.

## Getting Changes

To retrieve work that other pairs have done, use the `upstream` remote: `git pull upstream master`

## Code Style

Please follow the [AirBnB Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby) and [JavaScript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
